            <p>
            I am so immersed in my knowledge that I feel as if I have already lived for a hundred trillion billion years on trillions and trillions of planets like this Earth. This world is absolutely clear to me, and here I seek only one thing—peace, tranquility, and that harmony that comes from merging with the infinitely eternal, from contemplating the great fractal similarity and from that wonderful oneness of existence, infinitely eternal, wherever you look, whether inward—infinitely small—or upward—infinitely large, do you understand? And yet you tell me again with your hustle, go and busy yourself; this is your distribution, your path, and your horizon of knowledge and perception of your nature—it is incomparably small compared to mine, do you understand? I feel as if I am already a deep elder, immortal, or at least almost immortal, who has been on this planet since its very birth, even when the Sun was just forming as a star, and this gas-dust cloud, after the explosion of the Sun, when it flared up as a star, began to form these coacervates, planets, you see. I feel as if I have lived on this Earth for almost five billion years, knowing it inside and out, and you tell me something… I don’t care about your cars, your yachts, your apartments, your well-being. I have been on this planet an infinite number of times, greater than Caesar, greater than Hitler, and greater than all the greats, do you understand? I have been both much more and much less than that. Somewhere I resembled a plant, somewhere more like a bird, somewhere a worm, and somewhere I was just a lump of stone; all this is the soul, you understand? It has facets of a completely diverse and infinite multitude. But you can’t understand that, so you go on; we live in this world with different sensations and different aspirations, correspondingly, our places are different, our distributions are different. I wish you all the coolest cars and the best partners; if you lack ideas, reach out to me, I will offer you a hundred trillion ideas for each of yours. Well, that’s it for me; I go as a deep elder who has glimpsed the eternal, touched the Divine, has become godlike, and is aimed at the infinite, and who dwells in tranquility, peace, harmony, grace, in that secret bliss, engaged in everything and in all, you see, that’s the difference between us. So I go to admire the universe, while you go to fulfill yourself within some LIMITS, that’s the whole difference, understand? You do not see the eternal infinite; it’s not needed for you. But at least you are, so to speak, more active, like that woodpecker pecking away, or the ant, who is very active in its path, so go ahead; our paths here, of course, have similarities because everything is one, but I understand you perfectly, while you are unlikely to understand me, because I, so to speak, contain you within myself; your nature makes up a tiny little grain of what exists in me, that’s all. So go, step away, and I will go enjoy the beautiful autumn sunset by the warm southern river. That’s it, go ahead, and I’ll go.

            I was excited by various music from all my life. Relativly recently i came in "renaissance" of my tastes and i became a rock lover. Also i used to play games, but right now i lose all will to play favorite games from my childhood, recently founded and general (I've been spend a LOT of time in mmo's and survivle games bruh. Like rust, ark and etc.)

            When i have some sort of inspiration i can draw/create something. Drawing and creating make me feel myself when i can't.

            The odds pleasures is my favorite. First one concluded in obsession with sounds (being suppressed by one melody or literally one specific tebmered note - one of my favorite. Imagine sitting and hear unstopable same sounds for hours). Also i can be ambushed by music that won't lemme give a brake to rest my ass on one place.

            Sometimes i feel myself acoustic, dumb, but who dfc, i either.
